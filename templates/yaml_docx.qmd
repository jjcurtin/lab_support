<!-- Other DOCX YAML options: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/docx.html
Note that ALL docx formatting options (including headers, margins, and font size) are controlled by the reference template doc.

Also note: To modify headers you must complete ALL the following steps:
1. Select the heading text you want to customize
2. Modify its styles the way you want
3. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, right-click the heading style that you customized and click "Update Heading to Match Selection". -->


# Header 1

Some text

## Header 2

More text

### Header 3

Even more text

#### Header 4

Unfortunately, word cannot handle a header and a paragraph on the same line. You can manually fix this in the output word doc by replacing the paragraph separator at the end of the line with ctrl-alt-enter
