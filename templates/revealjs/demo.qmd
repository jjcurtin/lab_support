## First Slide

This is a simple slide to demonstrate use of slide title using ## and the use of speaker notes using divs

New slides will start with each new title or the use of a horizontal line made up of -.   I use horizontal lines even when I have a title because it makes it easier to distinguish between slides IMO

This is a slide without a title and with first and second level bullet points

## Model Performance

Here is the  use of a callout div.  Useful occassionally?

The Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) indicates the probability that any true lapse is scored higher than any true no-lapse by the model

- Random performance:  auROC = 0.5 
- Perfect performance: auROC = 1.0 


:::{.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent

and our one hour model had the highest performance of all with an auROC of 0.93. 

Candidly, we hadn't anticipated that we could do this well with such high levels of temporal precision.  

But we can, and to be clear, we believe all three of these models to have clinically implementable levels of performance such that we can use them to make meaningful decisions for individual participants at specific moments in time.

But we can get much more than just lapse probabilities from these models. 

Using SHAP values, we can understand which features contributed most strongly to any prediction for a specific person at a specific moment in time.  This allows us to understand not only WHEN a lapse might occur but also WHY and potentially how best to intervene. 

For example, in this first plot,  I am showing you someone who would be predicted to have a high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery because they have been reporting high craving.  For that person, we could recommend urge surfing techniques or remind them that distracting activities can help get them through short periods of craving.

In contrast, a second person might have similarly high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery, but instead because they have lapsed a few times in recent weeks. They could be encouraged and assisted to complete activities designed to increase their motivation for abstinence.

And at a later point in time, that same person may have improved their abstinence motivation but now be at increased risk for a lapse because of a string of recent past and anticipated stressors.   

Now they could be provided with guided stress reduction or relaxation techniques that they could use each day.  

In this way, we can provide personalized recommendations to patients that are tailored to their unique risk profile at that moment in time.

## Next Steps: Algorithmic Fairness

::: {.notes}
So, obviously, we are really excited about the potential capabilities of this system for providing personalized continuing care.  

But not surprisingly, there are still a number of very important issues to address before we can implement this system.

The first issue is to assure that the models in our system are fair when used with individuals from different subgroups that have historically been disadvantaged in mental healthcare.

As one example of this issue, the data we collected to train these models from this first grant did not include much racial and ethnic diversity among the participants.

Given that, we were dismayed but not surprised to find that our models performed substantially worse when predicting lapses for anyone who wasn't white and non-hispanic.  

This is obviously unacceptable and we are working now to correct this.

## NIDA Project: A Larger, More Diverse Sample 

- Recruiting ~ 400 patients in recovery from Opioid Use Disorder 
- [National sample (size; diversity: demographics, location)]{style="color: blue;"}
- More variation in stage of recovery (1 – 6 months at start)
- Sensing for 12 months

\

Data collection will finish in December 2024

::: {.notes}
For example, we have been awarded a grant from NIDA to collect a more racially diverse sample using nationwide recruiting techniques.  

This sample will also include much needed geographic diversity because the factors that predict lapse in urban settings may be different from those that predict lapse in rural settings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps: Sensing Geolocation and Communcations

::: {.notes}

[PAUSE]

Next up.... as our monitoring and support system continues to mature, we will want a richer, broader set of lapse risk features so that we can distinguish better between different situations that require different supports. 

We can do this by engineering features from our location and communication signals, which tap into different experiences than what we measure by EMA.

::: {.notes}
To give you taste of the power for these novel signals, here is a wide view of my moment-by-moment location detected by a GPS app over a month when we were first experimenting with this sensing method.  The app recorded the paths that I traveled, with movement by car in green and running in blue.

The red dots indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.

And although not displayed here, the app recorded the days and exact times that I was at each of these locations.

From these data, you can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs on the weekends in the county and state parks to the west and northwest.

::: {.notes}
Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, these data show that I drove my children halfway around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And from these data we might be able to detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes **very late**, to school!

The app recorded my daily running commute through downtown Madison to and from my office.  From this, we can observe my longs days at the office and also those days that I skipped out.

Looking at the red dots indicating the places I visit, the system can detect the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops where I eat, drink and socialize.  We can use public map data to identify these places and make inferences about what I do there.

[PAUSE]

Both geolocation and communications data are powerful sensed signals that we have already begun to use to predict lapse risk with success.

And we plan to implement a model with both EMA and geolocation for a new project that we are just launching now.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps: Optimize System Feedback to Patients 

- Sensing EMA and geolocation for six months
- Model updated each night (4 am) for next day
  - Lapse probability prediction
  - Recent trend in lapse probability
  - Important risk features
  - Risk relevant support recommendation
  
- Participants receive daily messages varying combinations of these components

- Measure trust, utility, engagement, and clinical outcomes

Grant funded in September 2024

::: {.notes}
And that brings us to perhaps the most important next step.

Just because our prediction models perform well, doesn't guarantee that they will provide meaningful clinical benefits.

We need to be able to provide feedback from these models to patients such that they trust the system, find it useful, and engage with it over time in a way that improves their recovery.

And we were just awarded another grant from the NIAAA to do exactly this.  

In this project, we will be using a model with inputs from both EMA and geolocation.  We will use the model to make 

- daily lapse probability predictions, 
- identify current personalized lapse risks, 
- and map those risks to behavioral and support recommendations that are specific to each person each day.   

We can then manipulate what information we include in daily messages from the system to participants to increase their trust and engagement with the system as well as formally evaluating its clinical benefits.

Obviously, we are very excited to get started on this project because it will bring us one step closer to providing meaningful support to individuals in recovery.   

Thanks for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have now or later at the end of this session.
