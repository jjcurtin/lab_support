## Slide Titles, Separators, Bullets, and Notes 

This is a simple slide to demonstrate several big points

- We use `##` for slide titles
- We separate slides using a string of `-----------` (though a title starts a new slide by default too)
- See the notes div for presenter notes (and info in the notes!)
- Bullets work as expected given markdown
  - so do sub-bullets
  

::: {.notes}
This is a field to put notes that you can see in the presenter view.  

Divs begin with `:::` and end with `:::`
You the number of `:` is arbitrary but should match when nesting divs.
You specify the class of the div in the curly braces.  In this case, we are using the class "notes"
Divs have many other uses including for callouts and to control the appearance of the slide.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a slide without a title.  The use of `---` is sufficient to separate slides.

This slide also displays an image.

- Notice the control of image placement and size inside curly braces
- The image can saved and loaded from github or could be saved locally with your qmd file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quotes

This slide demonstrates the use of a quote with `>`

- Notice the use of colored text.  This can be used with any text, not just quotes
- Notice the use of <br> to create line breaks in the text

\
\

> “Could you predict not only [who]{style="color: blue;"} might be at greatest risk for relapse … <br>
 … but precisely [when]{style="color: blue;"} that relapse might occur … <br>
 … and [how best to intervene]{style="color: blue;"} to prevent it?"
 
 \
 \

Here is normal text after the quote.  Notice the addition of extra lines to increase spacing using `\`

::: {.notes}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sequential Bullet Points

- Precision mental health requires us to provide the [right interventions]{style="color: blue;"} and supports to the <br>[right people]{style="color: blue;"} at the [right time]{style="color: blue;"}, [every time]{style="color: blue;"}



::: {.notes}
I like to split bullet points across slides and turn them gray when they are no longer the focus. It allows more room for notes split across slides.  

Alternatively, bullet points can be set to appear sequentially on a single slide.  

- There is more detail on how to implement that approach in the quarto documentation.  
- Here is the link:  https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/
- I highly recommend reading the documentation to get a sense of the full/additional capabilities of revealjs for presentations.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sequential Bullet Points

- [Precision mental health requires us to provide the right treatments and supports to the <br>right people at the right time, every time]{style="color:gray;"}

- Continuing care for substance use disorders requires [long-term monitoring]{style="color: blue;"} and <br>[ongoing lifestyle adjustments and support]{style="color: blue;"} to prevent relapse


::: {.notes}
Now I could insert note specific to this second bullet point here!
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Callouts 

Here is the use of a callout div

- There are a few types
  - note
  - tips
  - important
  - caution
  - warning

- The types vary in the header color and icon
- You can find more detail on the [quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-13-feature-callouts/)

:::{.callout-tip}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent  
:::

::: {.notes}


:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Footers


You can add footers to specific slides using a footer div

::: footer
Curtin et al., 2024
:::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Callouts 

- You can suppress the icon if you want using `{.callout-tip icon=false}`

:::{.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent  
:::

::: {.notes}


:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plots

You can make plots directly in the slides using R code chunks

- You need to load relevant libraries and set themes, etc (once)
- You can set the size of the plot in the chunk options and suppress messages

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-height: 2

library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_classic()) 

# dataset:
tibble(value = rnorm(100)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=value)) + 
    geom_histogram()
```

::: {.notes}


:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Columns 

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="60%"}
We can break the slides up into columns

- We use nested divs for this
- Top level div (use `::: {.columns}`) to start the container for the columns.  End the columns with `:::`
- Next level div (use `::::`) is the container for each column.  End each column with `::::`
:::::

:::: {.column width="40%"}
The columns can be of different widths

- Specify the width for each specific column with the div that starts the column
- e.g., `:::: {.column width="40%"}`
::::
:::

::: {.notes}


:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plots 

You can use columns to put plots side by side.  Notice here that this overall text appears before the start of the columns container so it is not in columns but instead full width

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 6


```
:::::


:::: {.column width="50%"}
The columns can be of different widths

- Specify the width for each specific column with the div that starts the column
- e.g., `:::: {.column width="40%"}`

## Model Performance: Excellent auROCs

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="40%"}
:::::{.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent  
:::::
::::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| label: figs_auroc_ci_3
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 6

# fig_auroc_ci_3
```
::::
:::

::: {.notes}
and our one hour model had the highest performance of all with an auROC of 0.93. 

Candidly, we hadn't anticipated that we could do this well with such high levels of temporal precision.  

But we can, and to be clear, we believe all three of these models to have clinically implementable levels of performance such that we can use them to make meaningful decisions for individual participants at specific moments in time.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Beyond Prediction: Personalized Recommendations 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 5

# source(here::here("figs/opt/figs_opt_shaps.R"))
# fig_shap_ex1
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<!--Blank

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<!-- Blank-->

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
But we can get much more than just lapse probabilities from these models. 

Using SHAP values, we can understand which features contributed most strongly to any prediction for a specific person at a specific moment in time.  This allows us to understand not only WHEN a lapse might occur but also WHY and potentially how best to intervene. 

For example, in this first plot,  I am showing you someone who would be predicted to have a high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery because they have been reporting high craving.  For that person, we could recommend urge surfing techniques or remind them that distracting activities can help get them through short periods of craving.

```

<!--Blank-->
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
In contrast, a second person might have similarly high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery, but instead because they have lapsed a few times in recent weeks. They could be encouraged and assisted to complete activities designed to increase their motivation for abstinence. 
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Beyond Prediction: Personalized Recommendations 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 5

# fig_shap_ex3
```
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
And at a later point in time, that same person may have improved their abstinence motivation but now be at increased risk for a lapse because of a string of recent past and anticipated stressors.   

Now they could be provided with guided stress reduction or relaxation techniques that they could use each day.  

In this way, we can provide personalized recommendations to patients that are tailored to their unique risk profile at that moment in time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps: Algorithmic Fairness

::: {.notes}
So, obviously, we are really excited about the potential capabilities of this system for providing personalized continuing care.  

But not surprisingly, there are still a number of very important issues to address before we can implement this system.

::: {.notes}
The first issue is to assure that the models in our system are fair when used with individuals from different subgroups that have historically been disadvantaged in mental healthcare.

As one example of this issue, the data we collected to train these models from this first grant did not include much racial and ethnic diversity among the participants.

::: {.notes}
Given that, we were dismayed but not surprised to find that our models performed substantially worse when predicting lapses for anyone who wasn't white and non-hispanic.  

This is obviously unacceptable and we are working now to correct this.

## NIDA Project: A Larger, More Diverse Sample 

- Recruiting ~ 400 patients in recovery from Opioid Use Disorder 
- [National sample (size; diversity: demographics, location)]{style="color: blue;"}
- More variation in stage of recovery (1 – 6 months at start)
- Sensing for 12 months

\

Data collection will finish in December 2024

::: {.notes}
For example, we have been awarded a grant from NIDA to collect a more racially diverse sample using nationwide recruiting techniques.  

This sample will also include much needed geographic diversity because the factors that predict lapse in urban settings may be different from those that predict lapse in rural settings.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps: Sensing Geolocation and Communcations

::: {.notes}

[PAUSE]

Next up.... as our monitoring and support system continues to mature, we will want a richer, broader set of lapse risk features so that we can distinguish better between different situations that require different supports. 

We can do this by engineering features from our location and communication signals, which tap into different experiences than what we measure by EMA.

::: {.notes}
To give you taste of the power for these novel signals, here is a wide view of my moment-by-moment location detected by a GPS app over a month when we were first experimenting with this sensing method.  The app recorded the paths that I traveled, with movement by car in green and running in blue.

The red dots indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.

And although not displayed here, the app recorded the days and exact times that I was at each of these locations.

From these data, you can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs on the weekends in the county and state parks to the west and northwest.

## {#gps_detection_2 data-menu-title="GPS detection, zoomed" background-image="https://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/present/john_gps_zoom.png" background-size="100%" background-position="bottom" background-repeat="none"}


::: {.notes}
Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, these data show that I drove my children halfway around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And from these data we might be able to detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes **very late**, to school!

The app recorded my daily running commute through downtown Madison to and from my office.  From this, we can observe my longs days at the office and also those days that I skipped out.

Looking at the red dots indicating the places I visit, the system can detect the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops where I eat, drink and socialize.  We can use public map data to identify these places and make inferences about what I do there.

[PAUSE]

Both geolocation and communications data are powerful sensed signals that we have already begun to use to predict lapse risk with success.

And we plan to implement a model with both EMA and geolocation for a new project that we are just launching now.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps: Optimize System Feedback to Patients 

- Sensing EMA and geolocation for six months
- Model updated each night (4 am) for next day
  - Lapse probability prediction
  - Recent trend in lapse probability
  - Important risk features
  - Risk relevant support recommendation
  
- Participants receive daily messages varying combinations of these components

- Measure trust, utility, engagement, and clinical outcomes

Grant funded in September 2024

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/opt_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
And that brings us to perhaps the most important next step.

Just because our prediction models perform well, doesn't guarantee that they will provide meaningful clinical benefits.

We need to be able to provide feedback from these models to patients such that they trust the system, find it useful, and engage with it over time in a way that improves their recovery.

And we were just awarded another grant from the NIAAA to do exactly this.  

In this project, we will be using a model with inputs from both EMA and geolocation.  We will use the model to make 

- daily lapse probability predictions, 
- identify current personalized lapse risks, 
- and map those risks to behavioral and support recommendations that are specific to each person each day.   

We can then manipulate what information we include in daily messages from the system to participants to increase their trust and engagement with the system as well as formally evaluating its clinical benefits.

Obviously, we are very excited to get started on this project because it will bring us one step closer to providing meaningful support to individuals in recovery.   

Thanks for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have now or later at the end of this session.
