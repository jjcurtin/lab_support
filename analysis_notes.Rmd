### General Programming Tips


### Functions


### Dates and Time

* `write_csv()` and `vroom_write()` save ddtm variables in UTC timezone regardless
of the timezone for the variable in the tibble.  It appends a "Z" on the end of the
time to indicate that it is in UTC.  These times will read back into R correctly
but the timezone will be UTC.  Change back to appropriate timezone using `with_tz()`
in a `mutate()`
