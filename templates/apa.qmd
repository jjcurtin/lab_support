This is my introductory paragraph. The title will be placed above it automatically. *Do not start with an introductory heading* (e.g., "Introduction"). The title acts as your Level 1 heading for the introduction.

Readers are better able to follow your ideas if you differentiate sections in your introduction with headings. Mostly stick to level 2 headers. Sometimes level 3 headings are needed, though. Be sparing to the point of stinginess with levels 4 and 5.

## Level 2 Heading: Flush Left, Bold, Title Case

Subsections of the introduction have level 2 headings. A paragraph after a level 2 Heading is on a new line. Regular paragraphs are indented, flush left, and double-spaced.

You do not need to put text after a heading. You can put a higher-level heading directly underneath if you want.

## A Level 2 Heading Without Text Below It

### Level 3 Heading: Flush Left, Bold Italic, Title Case

Subsections of a level 2 heading are placed under level 3 headings.

### Another Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading.

A level 4 heading should be indented, flush left, bold, title case, and end with a period. A paragraph after a level 4 or 5 heading is on a new line in this markdown document but will appear as if it were in the same paragraph when rendered. You need at least one paragraph after a level 4 or 5 heading. If you forget the period at the end of the level 4 or 5 heading, it will be added automatically. A period will not be added if the heading ends with a question mark or an exclamation point.

Subsequent paragraphs go on their own lines.

##### Level 5 Heading

A level 5 heading should be indented, flush left, bold italic, title case, and end with a period. Notice that there was no period after this level 5 heading in the markdown document, but it does appear in the rendered document.

Subsequent paragraphs go on their own lines.

## How to Cite References

I am going to cite a reference here in square brackets [@CameronTrivedi2013]. This reference was in my bibliography file. Here are some variations on parenthetical citations:

-   Page references (or any other suffixes are placed after the reference. If you want a comma, you'll need to insert it yourself: [@CameronTrivedi2013, pp. 35--41]

-   Prefixes (with or without a comma) are placed before the reference: [e.g., @CameronTrivedi2013]

-   2 or more citations separated by a semicolon [@CameronTrivedi2013; @cohen2003applied]

-   Any prefixes or suffixes needing a literal semicolon will confuse Quarto (actually Pandoc). To make it clear that you need to print a semicolon, put a backslash before the semicolon: [FOIL\; @CameronTrivedi2013]

Text references are possible, too.

-   @CameronTrivedi2013 said some interesting things.

-   @cohen2003applied [pp. 101--103] said specific things on specific pages.

-   Place the reference's year by itself with a minus sign: [-@CameronTrivedi2013]

## Hypotheses, Aims, and Objectives

The last paragraph of the introduction usually states the specific hypotheses of the study, often in a way that links them to the research design.

# Method

General remarks on method. This paragraph is optional.

Not all papers require each of these sections. Edit them as needed. Consult the [Journal Article Reporting Standards](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars) for what is needed for your type of article.

## Participants

Who are they? How were they recruited? Report criteria for participant inclusion and exclusion. Perhaps some basic demographic stats are in order. A table is a great way to avoid repetition in statistical reporting.

## Measures

This section can also be titled **Materials** or **Apparatus**. Whatever tools, equipment, or measurement devices used in the study should be described.

### Measure A

Describe Measure A.

### Measure B

Describe Measure B.

## Procedure

What did participants do?

How are the data going to be analyzed?

# Results

## Descriptive Statistics

Here we describe the basic characteristics of our primary variables.

Let's make a figure. A reference label for a figure in APA format must have the prefix `apafg-`. This is different from the usual Quarto prefix `fig-`.

```{r}
#| label: apafg-myplot
#| apa-cap: This is the figure caption.
#| apa-note: This is a note below the figure.

plot(1:10)
```

To refer to any figure or table, put the chunk label in curly braces. For example, see {apafg-myplot}. In {apafg-importedgraphic}, we import an image.

```{r}
#| label: apafg-importedgraphic
#| apa-cap: This is an imported graphic.
#| apa-note: My note.
knitr::include_graphics("orcid.png")
```

We can make a table the same way as a figure except that the label prefix is `apatb-`. Again, this is different from the usual quarto prefix `tbl-`, which will put the table table caption in the wrong place and with non-APA formatting.

```{r apatb-mytable}
#| apa-cap: Here is the table caption.
#| apa-note: Here is the note below the table.
#| ft.align: left


tibble(Numbers = seq(1,4), Letters = LETTERS[seq(Numbers)]) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  theme_apa() %>% 
  line_spacing(part = "all") %>% 
  padding(padding.top = 5, padding.bottom = 5)

```

To refer to this table in text, put the table's reference label in curly braces like so: As seen in {apatb-mytable}, there is not much information.

{apatb-withoutnote} is an example of a table without a note beneath.

```{r apatb-withoutnote}
#| apa-cap: This is a table without a note.
#| ft.align: left


tibble(Numbers = seq(1,4), Letters = LETTERS[seq(Numbers)]) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  theme_apa() %>% 
  line_spacing(part = "all") %>% 
  padding(padding.top = 5, padding.bottom = 5)

```

In {apatb-mymarkdowntable}, there is an example of using a plain markdown table via the `asis` engine.

```{asis}
#| label: apatb-mymarkdowntable
#| apa-cap: Table caption of a markdown table
#| apa-note: This is a note below the markdown table.
#| echo: true

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

```

What if you want the tables and figures to be at the end of the document? In the .pdf format, you can set the `floatsintext` option to false. For .html and .docx documents, there is not yet an automatic way to put tables and figures at the end. You can, of course, just put them all at the end, in order. The reference labels will work no matter where they are in the text.
